I grew up in Rome, Italy. After graduating in Philosophy from the University of Bologna (2003), I completed a PhD in Logic and the Methodology of Science at UC Berkeley (2009). 

In Bologna, I studied with Eva Picardi and wrote a (probably not very good) undergraduate thesis on Frege's Context Principle. At Berkeley, I wrote a dissertation on deontic modality, which was advised by John MacFarlane (chair), Branden Fitelson, and Niko Kolodny. I also learned much from Paolo Mancosu and Sherri Roush, as well as from my fellow graduate students, Mike Caie, Kenny Easwaran, and Mike Titelbaum. 

I began my career as an assistant professor at Northwestern in the Fall of 2009. Steph Curry began his with the Warriors at the same time, and he's going to retire before I do. I earned tenure at Northwestern in 2016. As of 2020, I am on the Philosophy faculty at UMD, where I became department chair in 2024. 

I live in Washington, DC, with my spouse and two children.
