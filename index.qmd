<!--
## Professor and Chair of Philosophy
-->

I am a philosopher at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I serve as chair of the Philosophy Department. I am interested in meaning, uncertainty, agency, modality, collective attitudes, the future, explanation, chance, mathematics, decisions, rationality, artificial intelligence, and more.

I can't write on everything in that list. I study modal language and thought to understand how we interpret, convey, and deploy information that goes beyond immediate experience. I have open projects on intention revision and creativity in artificial intelligence, temporal symmetries of inquiry, and reason-based semantics for normative language.
